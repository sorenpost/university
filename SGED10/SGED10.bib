  abstract = {Poor economies not only produce less; they typically produce things that involve fewer inputs and fewer intermediate steps. Yet the supply chains of poor countries face more frequent disruptions\textemdash{}delivery failures, faulty parts, delays, power outages, theft, government failures\textemdash{}that systematically thwart the production process. To understand how these disruptions affect economic development, we model an evolving input\textendash{}output network in which disruptions spread contagiously among optimizing agents. The key finding is that a poverty trap can emerge: agents adapt to frequent disruptions by producing simpler, less valuable goods, yet disruptions persist. Growing out of poverty requires that agents invest in buffers to disruptions. These buffers rise and then fall as the economy produces more complex goods, a prediction consistent with global patterns of input inventories. Large jumps in economic complexity can backfire. This result suggests why ``big push'' policies can fail, and it underscores the importance of reliability and of gradual increases in technological complexity.},

  abstract = {The Ghanaian Dumsor energy crisis of 2014/2015 led to dramatic, frequent, and largely unpredictable outages around the country. This paper exploits variation across garment making firms in self-reported blackout days using daily data over 7 weeks, combined with weekly panel data on firm inputs, outcomes, and network activity to study the effects of electricity shortages on small firms. We supplement our main identification with data on government load shedding schedules, and gps data on all electricity transformers in our sample area. Blackouts lead to economically meaningful declines in both weekly revenues and weekly profits; each additional blackout day is associated with an 11\% decrease in weekly profits on average. Firm owners respond to blackouts by working fewer hours during blackouts, without fully shifting labor supply onto non-blackout days. Expenditures on wages fall, suggesting that firm owners may shift from the use of higher paid workers to low wage apprentices.},
