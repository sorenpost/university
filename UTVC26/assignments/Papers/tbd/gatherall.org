 Research  question: What is the relationship between economic structure and resilience to economic shocks?

 Economic structure = capability-base 

 1. An analysis of the research question. What type of question is it (e.g. explanatory, descriptive, hypothesis-driven, etc.)?

    - TODO Hvad er research question?
      - Network effects
      - Product space?

 2. Motivate your question. What is the value added of your question to the general topic you are interested in and why is your way of formulating the question optimal?

    - Understanding the effects of capability-networks is in itself interesting.
    - The consequences of economic shocks are often hardest on the people that are most vulnerable. This also goes for countries where many people live on thin margins. Additionally, there are documented compounding effects that can be extra harmful to poorer countries. (Shocks and civil conflict, temporary job losses with permanent human capital investment losses, 
    - Just as the product space innovation can teach un-intuitive lessons to industrial policy, so can the network structure teach resilience-policies.

    - Economic shocks (proxied by rain fall) have been linked to increased conflict [note: It should be noted that some studies refute this claim, cf WEEZEL 2013].
    - Economic shocks have been linked to hysteresis effects: brazil and schooling (Duryea et al 2007), 
    - Economic shocks and crime (Brazil) - cf Dix-Carnio et al.


 3. A summary of your research design. E.g.; are you planning to do a single or comparative case study? A discourse analysis? Will you use qualitative or quantitative methods? Describe and motivate how you will go about when answering your research question!

** Introduction
 Is the ability of an economy to withstand and recover from economic disruptions conditioned by its productive structure? It has long been recognized that the diversity of an economy's industries and the relationship between them plays an important role in how economic shock propagates through the economy. Recent literature within the role of industrial networks and productive capabilities has highlighted the importance of the kinds of economic structures present in the economy. First, I briefly review previous literature and sketch the theoretical framework guiding the research. Second, the overarching research design, empirical strategy, and use of data is developed. Finally, I discuss potential findings and limitations.

 Most literature has followed the 'portfolio'-style theory of industrial diversity citep:deller_did_2016,martin_how_2016 where, much like stock-portfolios, diversity (defined by some "counting" measurement of concentration, e.g. Hirfendahl-Hirschman Index) has in-itself been assumed as barrier to shocks.

More recently, research has demonstrated how shocks to specific sectors central in the input-output network have outsized importance when hit by disturbances citep:acemoglu_networks_2016,acemoglu_network_2012,han_predicting_2019,klimek_quantifying_2019. These studies have shown the importance of considering both the structure of the economy and network effects when studying how economies deal with disruptions. Little attention, however, is given to the kind of productive structure that exists in the economy.

 In the past decade, an emerging literature on economic complexity and capabilities have demonstrated the importance of countries' export baskets in determining path dependencies for economic development: future diversification (product space), inequality (Hartman), and growth (Harvard Atlas, Dynamic Systems). An important insight from this literature is the ability to draw information from observable characterisics (the co-occurrence of economic activities) to unobserved determinants of an economy's fitness.

A central tensions between these

** Research design and methods
 The research follows a standard cross-sectional design [[cite:de_vaus_research_2001][48]]. While the Great Recession has been used in previous studies as intervention in a natural experiment-style design, this unfeasible for two related reasons. First, the use of a flexible dating method allows, and reveals, different onsets of the crisis. This ... 

 The benefit of using a rather wide set of countries is two-fold. Contrary to most studies on the impact of shocks, the evidence covers more than just advanced economies. Secondly, given the larger sample, the individual variation ... washed out, making it easier to parse out the variation accruing to economic complexity-variables.

*** Data
 The study employs two main sources of data: the international trade network (at the level of exported products) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at the national level. The data on international trade is used to construct the Product Space and all the related similarity- and network metrics. The GDP-data is used as the reference metric to identify economic shocks.

 The data on product exports comes from the UN COMTRADE database (United Nations International Trade Statistics Database). Many countries do not report trade consistently which results in errors in the data. They are  harmonized and cleaned through the Bustos-Yildrim method. Essentially, the cleaning procedure exploits the double reporting of trade goods to suss out inconsistencies. Through the distance between the value reported by importers and exporters, each country can be given a 'reliability-score', which then acts as weights when reconciling differences in bilateral trade reportings (i.e. import vs export countries). This allows a wide, reliable coverage of bilateral trade flows at a fairly granular precision. For the purposes of this work, the bilateral trade-flows are aggregated into country-level exports at product level. The Growth Lab at Harvard University distributes the cleaned version of the COMTRADE data. Here, I use Harmonized System classification, 1992 revision (HS-92) at the four-digit level citep:the_growth_lab_at_harvard_university_international_2019. The HS-92 data covers about 5000 products at the 4-digit level, from 1995-2017. 

   - Issues w. trade data: [TODO]
     - Services are not included in trade data = misses important part of economy. 
     - Only exports = also misses important part of economy. However, most of the important results on grwoth, inequality, industrial relatedness, etc, from economic complexity literature is based on export data.

   As reference metric to identify shocks, I use GDP per capita data. As main source I use the Penn World Tables (9.1) (PWT) real GDP using national-accounts growth rates (RGDP^{NA}) citep:feenstra_next_2015. Since some variation exists in the estimation of GDP values, I repeat the analysis using the Maddison Project database citep:bolt_rebasing_2018 to avoid any results being an artifact from the source of GDP. There are two important issues with using GDP as the reference metric. First, there are well-documented problems with measurement errors in GDP in many less developed countries. For instance, cite:jerven_poor_2013 documents how certain patterns in GDP have systematic biases for different reasons (e.g. exogenously enforced policy changes) at different times in Sub-Saharan Africa. Second, many important shocks in less developed economies might be missed. The empirical strategy rests on identifying stagnation or absolute declines in GDP. One can think of many types of economic shocks that would qualify as significant disturbances to all or some parts of the economy that does not necessary involve a negative change in the level of the aggregate economy. This becomes doubly problematic for less developed economies, as they tend to experience growth slowdowns rather then declines in the absolute level of GDP [citation].

 Good thing about economic complexity approach: addresses other linkages and other differences in the industrial structure.


 *Product proximity externalities:* An important concept in the economic complexity literature is the idea of related diversification.

  That is, an economy is more likely to enter an economic activity with a capability-requirement

 

 *Hypothesis 1: Coherent product space:* If an economy has a high capability overlap between its activities (that is, products' pairwise product-space distance is small), it should be easier for the economy to re-direct resources to still productive sectors.

 *Hypothesis 2: diverse activities:* If an economy has a more diverse basket of economic activities, the "space of the possible" is wider. Therefor, it should be easier move 

 As such, there is an emerging consensus that regional economic resilience may be defined as the capacity of a regional or local economy to withstand, recover from and reorganize in the face of market, competitive and environmental shocks to its developmental growth path (Cooke, 2012; Bristow & Healy, 2014; Martin & Sunley, 2014).

The proposed study is a first, preliminary attempt at integrating the economic complexity literature with the literature on economic resilience.

** Background and motivation
** Review of Literature
*** Resilience
  Much like sustainability was before it, resilience has become a notoriously fuzzy concept[fn:2]. As such, it is helpful to clarify exactly what we mean by the resilience of an economy and how the research will operationalize the concept[fn:1]. This notion of resilience that is used for the purposes of this study is closely related to the conceptualization used in evolutionary economic geography citep:boschma_towards_2015. In the evolutionary framework, resilience is equally concerned with how regions sustain a long-term development path as with short term responses to disturbances. This is a reflection of evolutionary economics focus on the economy as in continuous change and development. As a broad concept, resilience is here to avoid stagnation and lock-in to a undesirable development path. 

 An important distinction is here the twin concepts of adaptation and adaptability. 

*** The importance of structural factors
 *Industrial diversity and resilience:* It has long been theorized that the resilience of an economy is connected to its economic structure. Many authors (e.g.cite:chen_geographical_2019,watson_economic_2017,deller_did_2016,martin_how_2016) either explicitly or implicitly follows the idea of a portfolio-theory of industrial diversity and risk citep:conroy_concept_1975. Much like a stock-portfolio, diversity per se is here associated with a spreading of the risk. Macro-economic disruptions are then less concentrated in the economy and "wash out", leaving most of the general economy functional. Empirical evidence of this relationship between economic diversity and resilience to recessionary shocks have been inconclusive [fn:1]. 

*** The promise of the economic complexity approach
*** The Product Space
 The product space framework provides us a way to quantify and formalize the relationship between the economic capabilities required for different productive activities. 

 To perform any productive activity effectively, an economy needs a set of appropriate capabilities. If an economy effectively produces a product, we assume that country possess the necessary capabiltiies to produce said products. If two products tend to be effectively produced by the same countries, these products share more of the economic capabilities required to make them. 

 By observing the revealed comparative advantage of countries in exporting different products, we can

 The main issue is endogenous effects in assignment and impact of the treatment. Recessionary shocks are not alike. It has documented that different kinds of shocks hit different economies in different ways, which again various over time. This posses two problems. First, if there is any kind of systematic relationship between the structural characteristics of an [economy] and the way that /specifically/ the Great Recession [impacts economies] the result might be informative for this particular case, but the external validity would be compromised. Second, if the sample of observations is not broad enough, potentially unrelated characteristics (such as national depths, access to foreign credit, market openness, finanzialisation of the local economy) driving which countries are hit by the recession might drown out more general structural effects.

** What is the Product Space
 The product space is a network representation of the relationship between the economic capabilities required to effectively make products. The network is build from a simple set of assumption: if a country effectively produces a product, we assume that country possess the required economic capabilities to produce said products. We then say that if two products tend to be effectively produced by the same countries, these products share more of the economic capabilities required to make them.

 The products space framework have illutstrated the importance of this relationship between the products already produced by a country (that is, the economic capabilities) and how the economy subsequently diversifies. 

 This also means that not all products are equal. Some products are more densely connected to other products, meaning that they share capabilities with a wider group of products. This also means that countries that produced these more connected products have a wider space of possible future diversification.

 Just as studying why economies grow is an important part of ..., so is understanding why they fail. Negative economic shocks have been linked to  adverse social welfare outcomes, such as increases in crime citep:dix-carneiro_economic_2017,iyer_poverty_2014 and conflict citep:hodler_economic_2014-1,kim_revisiting_2016,bazzi_economic_2014[fn:3]. Perhaps even more significantly, evidence suggest that economic contractions has lasting effects on the economy's future output. cite:cerra_growth_nodate,cerra_international_2013 demonstrate how, on average, economies does not recoup the lost growth after recessionary shocks. This results in a large welfare-gap between post-recession shocks and counterfactual scenarios. In addition, many economies do not return to earlier growth-trajectories after recessions which has been a significant factor in unconditional divergence in post-world war growth numbers.

* Final exam draft
** Introduction
*** Background and context
    1. Impact motivation:
       1. Understanding what makes economies vulnerable to interruptions is important and have spawned an extensive literature.
       2. Economic disruptions tend to hurt those on the margins, that is, the vulnerable, the most.
       3. Economic disruptions have been linked to increases in crime citep:dix-carneiro_economic_2017,iyer_poverty_2014 and conflict citep:hodler_economic_2014-1,kim_revisiting_2016,bazzi_economic_2014[fn:1].
       4.The literature documents hysteresis effects, where temporary shocks create lasting effects in the economy. cite:cross_foundations_1993, cite:martin_regional_2012-1 documents a higher "natural" unemployment after recessionary shocks. Some shock hysteresis effects might be doubly costly for developing countries: for instance, citep:duryea_effects_2007 shows that household job-losses leads to earlier entry to the labor-market for children. This decreases the rate of human capital accumulation, which could affect future growth rates.
    2. Academic motivation:
       1. There has long been a link between the industrial structure and the vulnerability of an economy citep:conroy_concept_1975. All else equal, it is assumed that a more diverse "portfolio" of industries results in a more resilient economy citep:martin_regional_2012-1. This line of research has primarily employed "counting" measures of industrial diversity, such as entropy-based indices based on the number of sectors accounting for some share of total output. 
       2. More recently, attention have been given to how the relationship between industries in the input-output (I/O) network propagates disruptions to the wider economy citep:acemoglu_networks_2016,acemoglu_network_2012,han_predicting_2019,klimek_quantifying_2019. These studies have shown the importance of network effects between economic activities.
       3. This study would compliment these traditions by using the relationship between economic activities in the capability network (the product space). Does a more "coherent" industry-mix mean the economy can better re-adjust resources to still productive parts of the economy? Or does a more dispersed Product Space lead to an easier "local search" (i.e. cost-discovery is smaller)? I.e. it is important to recognize that industries are not alike, and neither are their pairwise relationships.
    3. Economic complexity and economic structure: 
       1. The economic complexity literature has reformulated economic growth with impressive results. The product-space framework has shown the changes in the economy exhibit a "principle of relatedness", which has a strong influence on the development of nations.
       3. The distance between products in the network can inform us to the capability overlap between products. We can again leverage this information to tell us about the capability base of a given economy. If an economy possess a larger part of the necessary capabilities required by a product, the economy is more likely to begin exporting said in the future. In other words, [bla bla] re-orient productive resources in the economy.

*** Problem statement
 What is the relationship between economic structure (measured as the capability-base) and the impact and recovery from economic downturns?

*** Research questions
 [TODO: translate RQs to hypotheses and elaborate formal tests]

 - Relationship between capability-base and impact of economic shocks:
   1. Is a more coherent industrial structure associated with smaller impacts of economic shocks?
   2. Is a more coherent industrial structure associated with faster recovery from economic downturns?
   3. Is a more sophisticated industry-mix associated with smaller impacts of economic shocks?
   4. Is a more sophisticated industry-mix associated with faster recovery from economic downturns?

 - Relationship between capability-base, economic shocks, and structural change:
   1. Are economic shocks associated with changes in the rate of economic diversification?
   2. Are economic shocks associated with changes in the direction of economic diversification (related and unrelated diversification)?

** Research design and methods
*** Methodology

 *Build product space (similarity-scores):*

 *Identification of shocks:* Economic shocks tend to spread to different economies in many ways, hitting some early and some late, with patterns changing between different types of shocks. As such, it is important to allow for a flexible, data driven dating of the economic shock. I use a modified version of the BBQ algorithm presented by cite:harding_dissecting_2002 to date the business cycles. The BBQ is a refinement of the method presented by cite:bry_cyclical_1971. A business cycle is here defined as lasting from one peak to the next peak, with turning points defined as an observed or implied growth rate of 0. I follow citep:sensier_measuring_2016-1 in adapting the process to yearly data (by adjusting the censoring requirement). Each country is then treated as a separate time-series.

*** Data
 The study employs two main sources of data: the international trade network (at the level of exported products) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at the national level.

 The data on product exports comes from the UN COMTRADE database (United Nations International Trade Statistics Database). Many countries do not report trade consistently which results in errors in the data. They are  harmonized and cleaned through the Bustos-Yildrim method. Essentially, the cleaning procedure exploits the double reporting of trade goods to suss out inconsistencies. Through the distance between the value reported by importers and exporters, each country can be given a 'reliability-score', which then acts as weights when reconciling differences in bilateral trade reportings (i.e. import vs export countries). This allows a wide, reliable coverage of bilateral trade flows at a fairly granular precision. For the purposes of this work, the bilateral trade-flows are aggregated into country-level exports at product level. The Growth Lab at Harvard University distributes the cleaned version of the COMTRADE data. Here, I use Harmonized System classification, 1992 revision (HS-92) at the four-digit level citep:the_growth_lab_at_harvard_university_international_2019. The HS-92 data covers about 5000 products at the 4-digit level, from 1995-2017. 

   - Issues w. trade data: [TODO]
     - Services are not included in trade data = misses important part of economy. 
     - Only exports = also misses important part of economy. However, most of the important results on grwoth, inequality, industrial relatedness, etc, from economic complexity literature is based on export data.

   As reference metric to identify shocks, I use GDP per capita data. As main source I use the Penn World Tables (9.1) (PWT) real GDP using national-accounts growth rates (RGDP^{NA}) citep:feenstra_next_2015. Since some variation exists in the estimation of GDP values, I repeat the analysis using the Maddison Project database citep:bolt_rebasing_2018 to avoid any results being an artifact from the source of GDP. There are two important issues with using GDP as the reference metric. First, there are well-documented problems with measurement errors in GDP in many less developed countries. For instance, cite:jerven_poor_2013 documents how certain patterns in GDP are biased for different reasons (e.g. exogenously enforced policy changes) at different times in Sub-Saharan Africa. Second, many important shocks in less developed economies might be missed. The empirical strategy rests on identifying stagnation or absolute declines in GDP. One can think of many types of economic shocks that would qualify as significant disturbances to all or some parts of the economy that does not necessary involve a negative change in the level of the aggregate economy. This becomes doubly problematic for less developed economies, as they tend to experience growth slowdowns rather then declines in the absolute level of GDP [citation].

*** Limitations

 - No randomisation = no causality, only covariance.
 - National scale = many of the interesting dynamcs between regions are lost.
 - No labor-market data = important source of local adjustment is lost.
 - Cross-country limitations
 - Value added issue: when export is currently so unbundled/fragmented, it makes less sense to categorise exports into specific products. Instead they should be divided into different activities along the quality ladder. See paper by cite:brakman_closer_2017 (fx. RCA for China in computers dissappear, instead they have RCA in assembly). Issue with the WIOD database is that it only covers 40 countries and 50-something sectors.
 - Endogeneity issues. Fx market openness affecting both industrial structure and impact of shocks.

 Besides more research-technical considerations on computational and experimental reproducibility, there are no obvious ethical issues. No microdata, non-public data, or sensitive data is used in the analysis. Given the nature of the design, it is difficult to imagine any sensitive results to emerge. To make reproduction and transparency easier, the final project will be aggregated into a R package (including figures, R code and cleaning producedures) and hosted online.

** Literature

 - Resilience: as both ability to withstand and recover, but also to re-organize and thrive
 - The importance of structural factors
 - The promise of the economic complexity approach
   - Basic points about product density:
     - easier to produce new products that are close to your base
     - more new firms survive i "dense" areas
     - labor is more easily re-absorbed into the economy when there are related activities in area
     - denser export might also lead to more lock in. if something in the crisis changes the capabilities of the economy, the whole would suffer more, or if technological change shifts the value of the respective comparative advantage.

** Research questions
  
 - Question to the immediate impact
 - Question to the structural change

** Methodology and data

 - Cross sectional design
   - Identify important mediating variables.
 - Identify shocks, use as treatment
 - Use variables identified in a future lit. review. Preliminary variables: innovation capacity, bla bla bla.
 - regressions and network effects
 - monte carlo permutation tests
 - Data

 - More:
   - Selection bias in treatment administration

** Limitations and ethics

 - Causality is very difficult: no randomisation, no great IV instrument, other types require too strong assumptions.
 - Cross-sectional design has limitations
 - Use of countries as main
 - Limitations that treatment is identified BY the outcome variable. That is, the only effect measured is from the impact of crisis. This misses any important changes in the economy before the recession has an impact

** Importance: 
 - Understanding the spaces of the possible is important in industrial policy. In recent years, it has been recognized that it is important to look beyond comparative advantage, to how the economic capabiltiies in an economy conditions the fitness landscape (?). An important contribution by this line of research would be guiding industrial policy to build not only a growing economy but a resilient one.

** Introduction
 Short paragraph on importance of understanding recessions and resilience.

 Is the ability of an economy to withstand and recover from economic disruptions conditioned by its productive structure? It has long been recognized that the diversity of an economy's industries and the relationship between them plays an important role in how economic shock propagates through the economy. Empirical lit = inconclusive. 

 Recent literature on the role of economic complexity and productive capabilities has highlighted the importance of the kinds of economic structures present in the economy. + novel ways of inferring the relationship between economic activities. The proposed study is a first, preliminary attempt at integrating the economic complexity literature with the literature on economic resilience.:

*** Conceptualising resilience
  Much like sustainability was before it, resilience has become a notoriously fuzzy concept[fn:2]. As such, it is helpful to clarify exactly what we mean by the resilience of an economy and how the research will operationalize the concept[fn:1]. This notion of resilience that is used for the purposes of this study is closely related to the conceptualization used in evolutionary economic geography citep:boschma_towards_2015. In the evolutionary framework, resilience is equally concerned with how regions sustain a long-term development path as with short term responses to disturbances. This is a reflection of evolutionary economics focus on the economy as in continuous change and development. As a broad concept, resilience is here to avoid stagnation and lock-in to a undesirable development path.

 An important distinction is here the twin concepts of adaptation and adaptability.

* Peer-review
- Motivations: Why?

*Research design, scope and context:* 
So, basically, the study is a cross-country study of how resilient some 120 economies were to the Great Recession. The general idea is to leverage the recessionary shocks to measure how the capability base of an economy affects A) its resilience to disruptions (and how fast it recovers) and B) its ability to reorganize itself at renew or change its growth paths.

*Economic resilience and gaps:*
So, for a long time, there has been a theorised connection between the economic structure of an economy and how susceptible it is to shocks. Most of the literature has focused on more naive meassurements of industrial concentration or diversity, and on the whole, results have been inconclusive. Recently some important papers have shown how the structure of the input-output relationship between sectors can either transfer or isolate shocks. Very few, if any, efforts have been made to examine the structure of an economy's underlying capabilities and the relationship between economic activities in their similarity for how recessions affect economies. 

*Why cross country?* Most studies have only been based on advanced economies. A large cross country study would be able to catch a larger sample. Secondly, it is a question of data availability and sample size. Very few non-advanced economies have production data on a subnational scale. Those that do are typically only representative on a state-scale, meaning that the sample size becomes very small (like 7 - 15). This makes it hard to get a reliable statistical result.

*Identification of shocks:* Use classical business cycle approach: basically, when an economy shrinks, a recession starts. When the economy grows again to the previous pre-shock level, it has recovered. There is a lot of issues with this. For instance, labor growth would be better, but there is not a lot of data. This also pertains to developing countries which often have growth slowdowns, but less often have actual recessions. One approach is to use modern business cycle or growth cycles, where you estimate a deviation from a trend. But that requires a lot of assumptions on how to estimate trends, when to update them, when to define deviations, and so on. I would rather avoid that.

*Why economic complexity:*
So bascially, the economic complexity literature offers a way of relating the products an economy produces to each other. This can then tells us something about which economic capabilities exists in an economy. I want to test how the structure of the relationship between the capabilities in an economy can affect its resilience to recessionary shocks.

For instance, if the productive structures and capabilities within an economy is very closely related, that would suggest that many of the same economic capabilities are used by much of the economy. This could suggest that it would be easier for the economy to transfer the productive resources to parts of the economy that is still productive. For instance, research has shown that job-losses in a sector, where closely related sectors exists. The same result has been found between firm survival and related sectors.

On the other hand, such an economy would be less likely to be able to reorganize more distantly related capabilties. THis means that it could suffer a lock-in-effect, which means that if should its comparative advantage be less successful in the future, the economy could stagnate.

*What is the Product Space*
The product space is a network representation of the relationship between the economic capabilities required to effectively make products. The network is build from a simple set of assumption: if a country effectively produces a product, we assume that country possess the required economic capabilities to produce said products. We then say that if two products tend to be effectively produced by the same countries, these products share more of the economic capabilities required to make them.

The products space framework have illutstrated the importance of this relationship between the products already produced by a country (that is, the economic capabilities) and how the economy subsequently diversifies. 

This also means that not all products are equal. Some products are more densely connected to other products, meaning that they share capabilities with a wider group of products. This also means that countries that produced these more connected products have a wider space of possible future diversification.

*** Resilience and recessionary shocks
 In reviewing the literature on economic resilience, cite:martin_regional_2012-1 finds three main interpretations of the concept: 'engineered resilience', 'ecological resilience', and 'evolutionary resilience'. 'Engineered resilience' refers to how a system "bounce back" and return to its pre-shock state or path
