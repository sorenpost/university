* Sources and Source Criticism
  
Word count: 1081

We should evaluate sources in two distinct but related ways: can they provide the evidence needed to answer the research questions, and do they support the claims made from the research? In what follows, I focus on the former. I review the use of sources in two articles, /Capitaos and Chiefs: Oral Tradition and Colonial Society in Malawi/ by Woods (1990) and /The Case for Colonialism/ by Bruce Gilley (2018).

The stated aim of cite:woods_capitaos_1990 is to use oral testimonies to build a representation of the late-colonial Malawi. By contrasting how the local "indigenous community" portrays three aspects of colonial society (the use of machillas, the relationship between "planters" and the "indigenous community", and the evolution of modern chieftancy) with research based on concurrent, official colonial sources, Woods argues, the biases and misgivings in these official archives can be revealed. cite:gilley_case_2018, on the other hand, is a review article on merits of colonialism. While the article is less explicit on the research aims that informed it, Gilley identify two distinct points on which his case rests: "were colonialism objectively harmful?" and "is colonialism subjectively illegitimate"? (p. 169).

 Woods employ three main sources of data: interviews with local respondents (conducted in the summer of 1985), scholarly work based on official (colonial) archival records, and the archival records themselves (although to a limited extent). Since the aim of Woods research is to examine the difference between two representations of reality, an "unofficial" indigenous portrayal of colonial Malawi and the "official" portrayal from studies based on colonial archives, both the interviews and the scholarly work constitutes valuable primary sources.

 Oral testimonies to events some 50 years prior is not without issues. Woods contends that the portrayal of colonial Malawi through his interviews is not necessarily more correct than that of the colonial records. He reports disagreement within interview groups (Likambale interview, p. 261), actions being attributed to an already diseased estate holder (Nkhazingi interview, pp. 263-4) and informants unwilling to comment on certain topics (p. 263). 

 Despite the issues with the narratives of the informants, Woods does not go into any detail on the research process. He explicitly cites 15 different interview groups. No mention, however, is given of the exact number of interviews conducted, under which criteria the informants are selected (and very little about which societal class they represent), or the setting under which they were interviewed. One of the issues in source triangulation is the presence of bias in the correcting instrument, in this case the oral testimonies. Without transparency in the research process and without explicitly addressing researcher-as-instrument issues (e.g. positionality of the interviewer, see cite:scheyvens_development_2014, p. 62) there is no external frame of reference, making it difficult to asses the reliability of his findings [[citep:creswell_research_2017][p. 275]]. For instance, while he mentions that the Zomba History Project performs as intermediaries, he provides no reflections on their potential biases as gatekeepers. Much in the same way that colonial record-keepers were arbiters of information, locals with an "off-center" narrative of the colonial past might be less likely to be drawn upon.

 Gilley's article is, in essence, a review of literature on colonialism, and relies therefore on secondary sources. As a literature review, three general concerns towards the use of sources apply: does the cited literature meet scientific standards, is the topic's scholarship faithfully represented in the overall selection of material, and are the findings from the included material well represented? Gilley volunteers a few basic prescriptions for scholarship to meet the scientific standards required, namely research that is "careful in conceptualising and measuring controls, that establishes a feasible counterfactual", i.e. specifically the "non-colonial" experience, and does not cherrypick data [[cite:gilley_case_2018][p. 169-70]].

 While it is beyond this paper to provide a thorough review of Gilley's bibliography, and less so the colonial and post-colonial literature as a whole, two issues are instructive and worth highlighting. First, Gilley's article suffer from a distinct deficit of serious post- and anti-colonial critiques. For instance, the experience of Belgian Congo is addressed exclusively through a misrepresentation of the discussion about nation building in cite:sebe_post-colonialism_2014[fn:2], a quote from a "young man on the streets of Kinshasa" (pp. 178-9), a single, pro-colonial reference from (notably anti-colonial) Lumumba's "Congo, my Country" (p. 173) and the fact that the Belgian colonial /Force Publique/ exhibited a disciplinary superiority to the Congolese army (p. 184).

 Second, the sources Gilley reference to substantiates his empirical claims violate his self-defined standard of the feasible counterfactual and is based on data on one specific colonial experience (the late-era British colonies). One of the central claims in the article is that studies that follow the prescribed scientific standards tend to find Western ("British, French, German, Belgian, Dutch, and Portuguese", p. 169) colonialism a net benefit. He proceeds to list a wide range of supposed benefits to the colonised[fn:1]. To support this list of claims, he provides six sources. He cites two research articles citep:olsson_democratic_2009,lange_colonialism_2006, both of which study the variation in colonial legacies. That is, not in comparison with a non-colonial experience, but between colonies with different colonial institutions. Additionally, both studies find that any positive legacies are driven mainly by late-era British colonies. Next he cites two books concerned with British colonies citep:midgley_colonialism_2011,fieldhouse_west_1999, one of which is a study on comparative social policy development in the British colonies (again, no non-colonial counterfactual) that specifically writes how "ugly" of an affair colonialism was [[citep:midgley_colonialism_2011][p. 4]]. To this is added a study that document how the British created an ethnic identity by force in colonial Uganda citep:amone_british_2014. In other words, save for the final book citep:duignan_burden_2013, a controversial study from 1967, positive impacts of colonialisation are documented relative to other, more destructive colonial institutions, and the positives are almost exclusively driven by late-era British colonies. 

In conclusion, Woods use of oral testimonies and studies based on colonial data fits the study's internal logic well. However, in research where the main data is constructed, rather than accessed (such is in interview-based studies) transparency to the process, which he fails to provide, is critical. In making his Case For Colonialism, Gilley offers only a parodic review of the dissenting literature. More so, he fails to consistently meet even his own scientific standards, falling victim to the very same "epistemic" shortcomings he accuses the post-colonial literature of.

* Make-up assignment, seminar 2
*Based on the two papers by Woods (1990) and Gilley (2018), discuss the following questions:*

1. *Discuss what sources are used in the article by Woods and how are they used. Are the chosen sources optimal given the research question(s)/purpose of the article? In what way does Woods discuss potential problems with the sources he uses? How, if at all, does the author solve the self-proclaimed biases?*
2. *Discuss Gilley’s criticism of the post-colonial literature and its alleged violation of “epistemic virtues”, as well as Gilley’s arguments concerning the alleged benefits of colonialism. Is Gilley’s criticism justified and convincing? Does Gilley himself adhere to the “epistemic virtues” he lays out in the beginning of the article when evaluating the colonial legacy and making claims for the subjective legitimacy of colonialism? Note that, while the article is certainly controversial, you should focus mainly on evaluating the coherence of Gilley’s arguments and his selection of cases, and not the morality of his argument.*

*1.* In his introduction, cite:woods_capitaos_1990 lays out a clear research problem: to realize the potential of the Malawian archives,  "[researchers] must understand the flaws and biases in the official [colonial] records" (p. 259). To this end, he employ two main sources: oral testimonies (mostly from indigenous locals) and academic studies based on colonial records. From the oral testimonies he constructs a portrayal of three aspects of society in colonial Malawi. By contrasting the oral representation with the colonial Malawi portrayed in the scholarship, he argues, we can learn about how the colonial records are skewed.

For this purpose, the sources are well selected. The oral representations contain perhaps the only non-colonial, primary source on Malawi's colonial past. In conjunction, the academic portrayal based on the colonial records likewise constitutes a primary source to the portrayal of the time in question. That is, as a study on the variation between the two representations (oral and archival) it is very strong. The research's validity is self-referential: it rests on the quality of oral testimonies /as oral testimonies/ as well as the researchers ability to capably build and compare the two portrayals. However, Woods also makes further claims on certain parts of colonial society and how they should affect the interpretation of the official records. These are less secure. They require the oral evidence to faithfully speak to at least some parts of the conditions in colonial Malawi. This is a heavier pull on the data and includes issues such as the reliability and validity of interviewees as witnesses, the generalisability of findings, and representativeness of the interview sample. 

 For example, consider his argument on the duration of the use of machillas. One interview (Dziko, p. 261) insists they were in use until the 1930s, while an interview with "one of [his] best informants" (Likambale interview, p. 261) presents a confusion of the time-frame in which they were in use. In any case, the confused informant expresses a lingering resentment towards an infamous practice of carrying dogs around in the machillas. However, from the resentment expressed by Chief Likambale, Woods infer that "clearly, from beginning to end, Africans felt humiliated" and this (disputed) extension meant that the colonial administrators were "inexorably" so far removed that they were always seen as conquestors, that the indigenous community "never viewed the colonial administration with anything but loathing" (pp. 261-62). 

According to Woods, it follows then, that the colonial administrators were so "detached" from the indigenous population that it "debunks" studies based on secretariat notes and renders field report data from colonial sources untrustworthy [[citep:woods_capitaos_1990][pp. 261-62]]. While this may very well be the case, it is a strong claim following from what is presented as a disputed extension of a controversial practice (some 50 years before the time of the research) and a resentful sentiment expressed in a single interview. Woods does acknowledge that the colonial portrayal gleaned from the oral testimonies is "not necessarily any more accurate" than that from colonial sources. He does not, however, address that examples such as the one cited above constitutes central parts of his claims to the nature of the biases in the colonial records. 

In addition, Woods does not volunteer much information on how he found, evaluated and vetted his informants, nor does he provide any sketch of which part of society they represent. Since one would expect fifteen interviews with former capitaos to present the experience of working at a colonial estate differently than fifteen farmhands, this is a significant shortcoming. While the article is brief, an elaboration of the research process and (how findings are drawn out) could lessen this critique markedly.

*2.* In making his case for the return of colonialism cite:gilley_case_2018 criticizes the post-colonial literature for presenting a view of the colonial experience based on unsubstantiated claims, erasure of history and an unscientific treatment of the data.

To support his critique, Gilley provides a few "simple epistemic virtues" (p. 170) that constitutes a satisfactory scientific standard. Essentially, these virtues amount to non-biased data and case selection, the necessity of a "feasible counterfactual", and scientific decency (no falsification). In other words, research should not be cherry picked, and the colonial experience should be compared to the non-colonial experience. 

Studies that keep to these basic prescriptions, he claims, tend to find the colonial legacy a net benefit. To substantiate this claim, he lists a range of benefits accruing to former Western (British, French, German, Belgian, Dutch, and Portuguese) colonies: 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 "expanded education; improved public health; the abolition of slavery; widened employment opportunities; improved a ministration; the creation of basic infrastructure; female rights; enfranchisement of untouchable or historically excluded communities; fair taxation; access to capital; the generation of historical and cultural knowledge; and national identity formation, to mention just a few dimensions" [[citep:gilley_case_2018][p. 172]]
#+END_QUOTE

Two points are worth addressing in brief: First, his review of the post-colonial literature is limited at best. Consider, for example, the reviewed sources on the infamously rough experience of Belgian Congo: a study on how narratives in nation-building is changing in Africa citep:sebe_post-colonialism_2014, a quote from "a young man in the streets of Kinshasa", a page from a Patrice Lumumba-book and the fact that the Belgian colonial army were better trained than the Congolese. 

Second, a review of the sources provided for the list of colonial benefits above reveal A. that all but one of the six sources either concerns the British colonies (esp. in from the late-colonial era) citep:midgley_colonialism_2011,fieldhouse_west_1999,amone_british_2014 or the positive results are driven almost exclusively by the late-era former British colonies citep:olsson_democratic_2009,lange_colonialism_2006, and B. the two empirical articles both study the variation in outcomes from different colonial regimes, not against the non-colonial experience. That is, he provides sources that pertains to a very limited colonial experience (cherrypicking) and that studies colonial variation (that is, some colonial regimes were worse than others).

The quality of the sources we choose is dependent on both the formulation of the research questions and the strategy of inquiry. It is therefore worth spending a little time on discussing the precise research aim. In the following, I make the assumption that a range of villages are included in the project and that the study commence before the project is in effect. The research question

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
“How does participation in a community-based tourism project affect the empowerment of local communities in the region around Akagera National Park, Rwanda?”
#+END_QUOTE

references three notoriously fuzzy concepts in the development literature: participation, community and empowerment. Before addressing the choice of sources, it is helpful to delineate these concepts. First, if we define our research sites as local villages, participation can be taken to simply identify if the tourism project is present in the village. The question of what constitutes empowerment is impossible to answer without also addressing who is being empowered. In other words, the unit of analysis, the measurement, and the identification of valid observations rests on the operationalisation of the empowerment-concept.

In an authoritative article, cite:kabeer_resources_1999-1 offers a definition of female empowerment as a "process of change", during which those who have been denied the ability to make choices acquire such an ability. She distinguishes between the first order and second order choices. First order choices refer to life one wants to live: choices of livelihood, where to live, marital autonomy (if and to whom), and whether to have children. Second order choices refer to the quality of this life. 

This approach is closely related to Sen's capabilities and suffers many of the same methodological difficulties citep:miletzki_development_2017. It evolves around three dimensions: resource, agency and achievement. The resource-dimension refers to the access to allocated or future resources that facility the ability to act upon choices. Agency is the ability to define ones goal and acto upon it (meaning, motivation and purpose which individuals bring to their activity). Wheres the two first dimensions refer to the preconditions and process of empowerment, achievement is the actual empowerment present.

In practice, these concepts are difficult to operationalize. While resources are superficially the easiest to quantify, the /de jure/ "access" to land does not necessarily reflect an ability to act upon and utilize the resource. For instance, official co-ownership of land is often held in practice by men. As such, a resource that could be measurably attirbuted to a given woman would not in fact serve to increase her potential to realize choices. Agency, on the other hand, is a complex and political concept that runs in both positive (power over ones own life) and negative (power over other peoples lives) directions. Simple statistical measures can thus only perform as flattened portrayals of a deep process.

These issues suggest two things: empowerment should measure more than simple 'access' indicators and should be contextualised, and the data collected needs to combine a cross-sectional design with more in-depth, qualitative data. By using a cross-sectional data (such as surveys), we can facilitate a difference-in-difference causal identification (by comparing results with non-participating villages) as well as identify potentially heterogenous effects of the program. The issue of causality is especially important given that village-wide random assignment is unpractical (or not possible) for the community project. As such, a multi-stage, mixed-methods research design can provide a useful approach. 

In the first stage, a number of focus group-interviews would be facilitated with different segments of the participating villages. The main objective of these focus groups is two-fold: to get in an in-depth understanding of how empowerment is understood in the community and which obstacles to empowerment the attendees perceive to be most pressing, as well as to (in participation with the informants) construct a survey design that is contextually relevant and locally understood [[citep:scheyvens_development_2014][p. 54]]. The focus groups would be conducted before the project start. In the second stage, the survey is administered. Due to the potential scarcity, or unequal distribution, of digital records, sampling would be done using a grid-sampling design: a grid is overlaid unto a satellite image of the village. Quadrants are then randomly sampled, and a given number of respondents are approached in each quadrant. A survey should be performed before the project commmences, in order to provide a baseline. At research end, an additional set of focus groups and a survey would be conducted.

The multi-stage research design outline above provides two main types of data: the qualitative focus group-interviews and the survey results. One of the main benefits of the research design is the indicator relevance and validity. By constructing the survey variables in collaboration with the focus groups, it is possible to design a series of indicators that match the respondent's conception of empowerment. In addition, this reduces the likelihood of the survey being misunderstood by respondents, which increases the reliability of the responses [[cite:scheyvens_development_2014][p. 54]]. The use of a survey has the added benefit of lessening the risk of political bias in official statistics. It has been widely documented in the literature that official statistics has been used as an instrument of control citep:jerven_poor_2013 or as an avoidance tactic by marginalized groups cite:scott_seeing_1998. Finally, the triangulation between the qualitative group interviews and the survey results allows a broader interpretation of the findings. 

Many of the benefits listed above, however, is contingent on the quality of the focus groups. There are two main challenges, the capacity of the interviewer and the group interviewed. The lack of empowerment is usually a reflection of power relations, and as such, it requires a competent interviewer to facilitate an open and productive discussion. A related note is the positionality of the interviewer in the context of the community. For instance, if s/he represents characteristics that is central to the discussion of power relations, this can influence the quality of the focus group as a whole. Secondly, if the participants in the different focus groups does not sufficiently represent the different segments in the village population, or if the represent different segments than assumed by the research team, both the qualitative data and the survey data could be skewed. In addition, bias could be introduced in the survey results should the survey teams tend to visit specific types of dwellings at given times (e.g. later in the day for quadrants out of town). Should there be systematic difference (e.g. men and women) in who is home at which times, this would introduce a response bias in the survey results. Finally, given that the surveys attempt to measure potentially sensitive indicators (such as control over assets, freedom of choice, etc) the conditions under which the survey is taken - the gender of the surveyor, the people present at the survey location - could affect the results.

Some of these issues can be addressed through ensuring thorough training of interview and survey staff, as well as also randomizing which dwellings a visited first by the survey teams. However, while the issue of representation in focus groups can be mitigated by employing a mix of key informants (such as local NGOs), the presence of power structures or segmentation within the "community" could be invisible to outsider-researchers.
