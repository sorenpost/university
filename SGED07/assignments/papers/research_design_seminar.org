1. Empirical strategy
   - Identification of shocks
   - Dependent variable metrics
   - Network effects
   - Complexity of products
   - Regression

2. Issues:
   - Omitted variable bias
   - Treatment intensity
   - ex post impact of recessions

* Introduction
This paper is a brief presentation of the current research design in my
thesis-work. Given the limits on space, it doesn't make sense to be too detailed
on the construction or math involved in constructing the regression metrics. I
therefor outline the basic empirical strategy, use of data, and turn to a discussion of the main design issues.

* General design
The research approach is based around a cross-country regression design. At the
basic level, I construct a number of metrics that quantifies various qualities of the industrial
structure in a country and regress them on measures of how a recessionary shock
has impacted the economy. I use exposure to the financial crisis of the mid- to late 2000s
to identify different resilience-outcome between economies. The country sample
consists of 43 countries, covering about 85% of global GDP.

The benefit of using the cross sectional approach is two fold. First, it allows
a wider examination of the effect. Most studies have focused on a single advanced economy, neglecting potentially important
geographical and "developmental" differences internationally. Second, since
commodity data is mostly recorded at customs offices,  using countries as the
unit of analysis makes it possible to leverage international trade data to infer
the productive capabilities in each country. Commodity-level production data is
extremely rare at regional levels.

* Data
I use three main sources of data: national economic output (GDP),
international trade flows, and national input-output tables.

The data on product exports comes from the UN COMTRADE database (United Nations International Trade Statistics Database). This data is used to build the product-capability network. For the purposes of this work, the bilateral trade-flows are aggregated into country-level exports at product level. The Growth Lab at Harvard University distributes the cleaned version of the COMTRADE data. Here, I use Harmonized System classification, 1992 revision (HS-92) at the four-digit level citep:the_growth_lab_at_harvard_university_international_2019. The HS-92 data covers about 5000 products at the 4-digit level, from 1995-2017.

The World Input Output Database (WIOD) citep:timmer_illustrated_2015-1 provides the input-output tables used to build the input-output networks. The study uses the 2016-release covering 43 countries and 56 sectors (4 digit ISIC)from 2000-2014.

Finally, as reference metric to identify shocks, I use GDP per capita data. As main source I use the Penn World Tables (9.1) (PWT) real GDP using national-accounts growth rates (RGDP^{NA}) citep:feenstra_next_2015. Since some variation exists in the estimation of GDP values, I repeat the analysis using the Maddison Project database citep:bolt_rebasing_2018 to avoid any results being an artifact from the source of GDP.

* Key variables
I'm interested in estimating the effect of the relationship between productive
activities in an economy and its resilience to recessionary shocks. I quantify
the economic structure in three dimensions: network characteristics of
input-output relationships, the relatedness between products exported by the
economy, and the complexity of the products exported by the economy. Resilience
is measured in three dimensions: the depth of economic downturn after a shock,
the duration (and extent) of recovery, and the quality and degree of structural
change.




I'm interested in three resilience metrics: the depth of the
economic downturn, the duration and extent of recovery, and the degree and
quality of structural change.

I define recessionary shocks in terms of the classical business cycle approach.
Sinharding_dissecting_2002harding_dissecting_2002ks hits economies at different times, it is important to
allow for a data-driven dating of the shock. I follow
cite:sensier_measuring_2016-1 in adapting the BBQ dating algorithm from
cite:harding_dissecting_2002. The approach is simple. I treat each country's GDP
observations as a separate time series. A business cycle lasts from one local
peak to the next. Figure [[fig:stylized_bc]] shows a stylized business cycle. P^1
represents the first peak, P^2 the next.
When the first difference in the series becomes negative, a
shock starts (P^1 in figure [[fig:stylized_bc]]). The depth of the downturn is the
total decline in GDP until the first difference becomes positive. This is the
vertical distance between P^1 and B^1 in figure [[fig:stylized_bc]]. Recovery from a
shock is defined as having reach the pre-shock output level. The duration of the
recovery is therefor the time between B^1 and R.

* Text
This paper presents an informal discussion of the research design. The point of
the study is to investigate the relationship between the productive structures
of an economy and its resilience to economic shocks.

*Identifying observations:*



*The main issue:* concerns the assignment of treatment. While the lack of
randomization is itself an issue, there is a more significant obstacle in the
empirical approach.

Generally speaking, most (quasi-) experimental designs has some sort of treatment (applied a
given time) which affects the level of a variable. The difference in outcomes of the variable
across either different levels of treatment or treated/not treated groups is
used to infer the relationship between the treatment and the variable.

This differs from the approach in this paper in a few important ways. First, a
recessionary shock is essentially an observation of



The problem becomes clearer if we think of countries as patients and the
recessionary shock as the medicine we are testing. Currently, the model I've
proposed is interested in looking at whether certain patient specific
characteristics (the industrial organisation) has an important impact on how ill
the patients are feeling after having ingested the medicine. I'm fairly certain
the patients receive different doses of medicine, but I don't know which patient
has received a higher or a lower dose. I can only observe that some patients
become more ill than others. In other words, I don't know if patients that
become more ill has A) received a higher doses of medicine or B) whether
unobserved characteristics (say, bad diet) makes them more vulnerable to the
medicine. If any of these are true, any effect attributed to .. This becomes
much more important if (they co-vary with

Most studies either does not address the issue, builds their results from highly
stylized models, or makes the assumption that within a country every region is
subjected to the same economic pressure (and variation in outcomes is therefor
attributable to difference in regional resilience).
