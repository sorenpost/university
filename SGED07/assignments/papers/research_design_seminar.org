* Introduction
This paper is a brief presentation of the current research design in my
thesis-work. Given the limits on space, it doesn't make sense to be too detailed
on the construction or math involved in constructing the regression metrics. I
therefor outline the basic empirical strategy, use of data, and turn to a discussion of the main design issues.

* General design
The research approach is based around a cross-country regression design. At the
basic level, I construct a number of metrics that quantifies various qualities of the industrial
structure in a country and regress them on measures of how a recessionary shock
has impacted the economy. I use exposure to the financial crisis of the mid- to late 2000s
to identify different resilience-outcome between economies. The sample
consists of yearly observations of 43 countries from 2000-2014, covering about 85% of global GDP.

The benefit of using the cross sectional approach is two fold. First, it allows
a wider examination of the effect. Most studies have focused on a single advanced economy, neglecting potentially important
geographical and "developmental" differences internationally. Second, since
commodity data is mostly recorded at customs offices,  using countries as the
unit of analysis makes it possible to leverage international trade data to infer
the productive capabilities in each country. Commodity-level production data is
extremely rare at regional levels.

* Data
I use three main sources of data: national economic output (GDP),
international trade flows, and national input-output tables.

The data on product exports comes from the UN COMTRADE database (United Nations International Trade Statistics Database). This data is used to build the product-capability network. For the purposes of this work, the bilateral trade-flows are aggregated into country-level exports at product level. The Growth Lab at Harvard University distributes the cleaned version of the COMTRADE data. Here, I use Harmonized System classification, 1992 revision (HS-92) at the four-digit level citep:the_growth_lab_at_harvard_university_international_2019. The HS-92 data covers about 5000 products at the 4-digit level, from 1995-2017.

The World Input Output Database (WIOD) citep:timmer_illustrated_2015-1 provides the input-output tables used to build the input-output networks. The study uses the 2016-release covering 43 countries and 56 sectors (4 digit ISIC)from 2000-2014.

Finally, as reference metric to identify shocks, I use GDP per capita data. As main source I use the Penn World Tables (9.1) (PWT) real GDP using national-accounts growth rates (RGDP^{NA}) citep:feenstra_next_2015. Since some variation exists in the estimation of GDP values, I repeat the analysis using the Maddison Project database citep:bolt_rebasing_2018 to avoid any results being an artifact from the source of GDP.

* Key variables
I'm interested in estimating the effect of the relationship between productive
activities in an economy and its resilience to recessionary shocks. I quantify
the economic structure in three dimensions: network characteristics of
input-output relationships, the relatedness between products exported by the
economy, and the complexity of the products exported by the economy. Resilience
is also measured in three dimensions: the depth of economic downturn after a shock,
the duration (and extent) of recovery, and the quality and degree of structural
change.

** Resilience metrics
The first two resilience metrics is constructed from the recessionary shock.
I define recessionary shocks in terms of the classical business cycle approach
with GDP per capita as reference metric. Since shocks hits economies at different times, it is important to
allow for a data-driven dating of the shock. I follow
cite:sensier_measuring_2016-1 in adapting the BBQ dating algorithm from
cite:harding_dissecting_2002. The approach is simple. I treat each country's GDP
observations as a separate time series. A business cycle lasts from one local
peak to the next. Figure [[fig:stylized_bc]] shows a stylized business cycle. P^1
represents the first peak, P^2 the next.
When the first difference in the series becomes negative, a
shock starts (P^1 in figure [[fig:stylized_bc]]). The depth of the downturn is the
total decline in GDP until the first difference becomes positive. This is the
vertical distance between P^1 and B^1 in figure [[fig:stylized_bc]]. Recovery from a
shock is defined as having reach the pre-shock output level. The duration of the
recovery is therefor the time between B^1 and R.

** Economic structure metrics
Input-output characteristics: to capture the effects of supply-linkages between
  industries in each economy, I use input-output tables. These tables can readily be modeled as a weighted, directed network. Using this network, a series of network characteristics can be quantified (degree distribution, average path length, centrality measures).

Relatedness between products: I follow the Product Space framework
citep:hidalgo_product_2007-1,hausmann_atlas_2013 to quantify the relatedness
between products. From the international trade data we can identify which
products each country specialize in. If products tend to be present in the same
countries' export basket, they are more similar. If we model the relationship
between products in a weighted network (where links are relatedness-values) we
can leverage use the list of which products are present in a country to get
information on the relationship between countries and products. This allows us
to say something about how radical structural changes are. If countries expand
into products further from the products already in their export basket, this
represents are more radical departure than expanding into closely related
products. In addition, the pair-wise relatedness between products in a country's
export basket can tell us about the coherence of the economy's activities (that
is, how much overlap is there in inputs required).

Economic sophistication: To quantify the economic sophistication of economies I implement the
Fitness algorithm developed in cite:servedio_new_2018. Essentially, the
algorithm uses an iterative approach to "refine" information which products are
hardest to export. This results in a quantitative measure of which countries are
the most fit and which products are the most complex. If a country tends to
export more complex products, it is more fit. Similarly, if a product tends to
be exported only by very fit countries, the product is more complex.

* Limitations and obstacles
There are currently several issues with the design. The two most significant
both pertains to the assignment of shocks.The issues becomes clearer if we think
of countries as patients and recessionary shocks as exposure to radiation. We are then interested in studying whether some
personal characteristic, height fx, impacts how long a person lives after
radiation exposure.

The first issue is simple. There is no random assignment of radiation between
patients. We can therefor only observe if the personal characteristics are
associated with outcomes are radiation exposure, not if they cause different outcomes.

The second issue is more serious. As the research design stands currently, there
is no observation of how strong the shock is, only how impacted an economy is.
This makes building a counterfactual scenario extremely difficult. In terms of
patients, there is no observation of how much radiation patients are submitted
to, only how sick they become. This means that should two patients live the same
number of years after exposure, they would be deemed equally resilient in my
model. However, if one of the patients were submitted to a very large dose and
the other a very small one, clearly one patient is more resilient than the
other. In my model, this is difference is not accounted for.
