*** Relevant findings
- From conclusion: Second, firms are able to reduce the negative productivity impacts of outages by altering their product mix in favor of less electricity-intensive products. This coping strategy can have broader implications for the variety of products available to consumers. Further, the results suggest that one of the most common strategies employed worldwide, the use of a generator, is unable to alleviate the negative productivity impact potentially due to the inability of small firms to efficiently use generators, given the substantial economies of scale in electricity generation. - /I.E. There can be effects on "complexity downgrading" in response to poor reliability./
