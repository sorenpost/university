## Annual Survey of Industries (ASI)
For data on the manufacturing industry in India, I use the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI)(TODO: CITE). The ASI is compiled annually by the Indian Ministry of Statistics. All registered factories with more than 100 employees (the "census scheme") is sampled every year. Smaller factories are randomly sampled every year, stratified by industry and state. 

Products are classicfed according to 5-digit ASI Commodity Classification (ASICC) codes.
