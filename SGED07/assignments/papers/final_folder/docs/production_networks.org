* Production networks

The idea that shocks can travel through production linkages dates back to at least Leontief (1936). More recently, a number of studies have shown how shocks to some sectors can generate aggregate fluctuations depending on the input-output relationships in the economy. We can think of two important types of O-ring effects in the production-network. The first relates to the use of intermediate inputs in the production process and the second relates to the supply chain.

To illustrate ... , I follow the production model used in much of the recent work on ... cite:acemoglu_network_2012. For now, I take one plant to be representative of the production in a given sector, where each plant makes a unique product that can either be sold to consumers or used as intermediate input in the production of a different product. We can then model a multi-sector production by

$$
x_i =  (z_i l_i)^{1-\alpha}(\prod^{n}_{j = 1} x_{ij}^{w_{ij}})^{\alpha}
$$

where $l_i$ is the amount of labor hired by plant $i$ and $\alpha \in (0, 1)$ is the share of labor in production. $z_i$ models some risk of production failure (or delay) due to exogenous factors (e.g. fire, theft, power outages, corruption) and has a similar role to $q$ earlier (more accurately, $z_i$ is 1 - the risk of failure). $x_{ij}$ is amount of the output by plant $j$ that used as intermediate input in the production of $x_i$. $w_{ij} \geq 0$ is the share of good $j$ in the total intermediate input use in the production of good $i$, and thus represents a sort of production recipe for plant $i$. I also take $\sum_j w_{ij} = 1$, i.e. there are constant returns to scale. If we stack the collection of  these $w$'s, we have the economy's input-output table.

For there to exist O-ring effects in this kind of production process, inputs needs to be largely inelastic. That is, if some input is delayed or spoiled, a factory cannot just use more of some other input. At least in the short run, this makes intuitive sense: in automobile production, any number of wheels will not make up for the lack of a gear-box.[fn:eq]

Empirical evidence support this intuition. For instance, by using the 2011 earthquake in Japan as natural experiment, cite:boehm_input_2019-1 finds evidence of a near 1-to-1 ratio between input and output losses, suggesting that the elasticity of intermediate inputs in manufacturing is near 0.[fn:eq2]

If intermediate inputs are non-elastic, the likelihood of something going wrong increases with number of intermediate inputs. If the producers of each input has the same $z$, the probability of having at least one input delayed with the number of inputs $n$ in $1 - z^n$.

This is essentially the O-ring effect shown in figure ref:TODO with $z = 0.95$.

- [ ] If intermediate inputs are non-elastic, the likelihood of disruptions rise with the number of intermediate inputs: the probability of having at least one of n input delayed rises by q^n. This is the O-ring problem.

- [ ] In longer supply chains, disruptions are more expensive then shorter ones. Essentially, this is a sequential O-ring problem of weak links. If complex products have more production "stages" than less complex ones, less complex products will be produced in more disruptive environments. If the supply-chain is completely vertical, the risk of having at least one failure (and therefor the expectation of output) rises by a factor of... (se Kremer papir). Usually, supply-chains are not completely vertical, so this effect is mediated. The effect decreases as links jump from node to node.

- [ ] Products with a larger share of primary inputs is less harmed by supply-chain disruptions. Intermediate inputs are the only type of inputs with network effects. Primary inputs (like labor in the model) only disturb the factory itself, and only mitigate through other factories use of it's products as input. More disruptive environments will then tend to have more primary inputs. If more complex products have less primary inputs, they are less likely to be present in disruptive environments.

Why is We can think of the production process


Empirical evidence suggest the intuition holds. By using the 2011 earthquake in Japan as natural experiment, cite:boehm_input_2019-1 finds evidence of a near 1-to-1 ratio between input and output losses, suggesting that the elasticity of intermediate inputs in manufacturing is near 0.

To see why,

* Notes
On one hand, firm-level idiosyncratic shocks should be quickly absorbed in production networks. Firms plausibly organize their operations to avoid being affected by temporary disruption to their supplies. Even when they face such disruptions, they should be flexible enough to recompose their production mix or switch to other suppliers. The gradual decrease in trade tariffs and transportation costs and the development of online business should make it even easier for firms to adjust their sourcing. On the other hand, frictions might prevent firms from quickly making adjustments in the event of supply disruptions. If firms face switching costs whenever they need to replace a disrupted supplier, idiosyncratic shocks might propagate from firm to firm and gradually be amplified. <-  Input Specificity and the Propagation of Idiosyncratic Shocks in Production Networks

Consider the three networks in/figure ref:io. The three configurations each represent different organisation of $w$'s in the model.

The first configuration is a vertical economy, where each sector gets all its input from ... In the right most model, node 3 gets half its input from 1 and half its input from 2. Node 4 gets all of its input from 3. For simplicity, lets say that half

[fn:eq] Which is why xxx found that when the 2011 earth quake in Japan closed the world largest airflow sensor factory (a central component in cars), many car manufacturers had to temporarily or permanently curb production.

[fn:eq2] The ability to substitute inputs does not need to be non-existing for the implications to hold, but the degree of disturbance or delay falls with flexibility.
