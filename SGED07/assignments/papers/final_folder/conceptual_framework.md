This paper draws on "weak link" approaches to economic development and the endogenous technological change approach. Weak link (Kremer, Jones) suggest that failure in production processes have large development costs. The economic complexity framework suggests that more complex economies, that is, those with more advanced (and larger number of) capabilities, grow more. Here, I build on a model combining these two general approaches. High disruption environments lead to producers self-selecting into less complex productions. A too large jump in complexity of the production process leads to a threshold that is too high to be maintained in the disruption environment. This means that even though production of more complex products yield higher returns, the decision backfires.

An additional interpretation is in why economies struggle to "jump" in complexity. Not only are capabilities hard to gain, but if they are not matched with the rest of the economy, there is much larger risk of being interrupted, loosing revenue. This could help explain why complex "push" interventions fail (e.g. drip irrigation) and why countries seldom "jump" in the product space.


Small disruptions can have large effects. In 1986, a defective O-ring (one part among hundreds of thousands) caused the Challenger space shuttle to explode mid-air, 73 seconds after launch. 

In 2011, the earthquake in Japan forced the Hitachi factory to close down. The factory produces most of the worlds airflow sensors, which is a critical input to most car production. As a result of the shutdown, car manufactorers on the other side of the world had to significanlty lower production or close down..


This paper is related to the "weak link" theories on economic development.

De vigtigeste pointer:

 - Weak links i production chains er vigtige. Hvis intermediate goods ikke bliver supplied eller bliver forsnikede, så skubbes det igennem hele kæden.
 - Høj-disruption environments kan lede producenter i mod mindre
