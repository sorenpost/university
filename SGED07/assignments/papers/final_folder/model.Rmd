# Model

The approach taken in this paper is closely related to the "O-ring" theory...

Where Kremer's model assumes that more complex production processes takes in more tasks, and risk therefor is related to the quality of the workers undertaking each task, 

Instead of focusing on the risk of each productions $n$ tasks and the risk of workers "messing them up", I focus on exogenous disruptions to the production process. a


The O-ring production function in Kremer (): Each firm combines some amount of capital (K) with a group of $n$ workers or tasks. Each task has $q$ probability of being produced accurately. If an error happens (food spoil, vases are dropped, wood is mishandled) the production output is 0. I the long run, $q$ thus represents the value of a given worker to the production output.

The expected output of a production is thus:

$$
E(y) = k ^{\alpha} (\prod^{n}_{i = 1} q_i) n B
$$

Hvis firmaet er alene så er det en simpel model, men hvis den er en del af et produktionsnetværk, så er det lig Kremers model.
