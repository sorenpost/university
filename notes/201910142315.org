* R coding: Proximity

 The starting point is the RCA matrix M.

 As above, I define proximity as: 

 \begin{equation}
 \text{Pr}(i,j) = \text{min}\{P(U_i|U_j),\text{ }P(U_j, U_j) \} = \frac{c_{ij}}{\text{max}\{v_{i} \text{, }v_{j}\}}
 \end{equation}

 First we need the co-occurrence matrix, ~cooc_ij~. This matrix is a product-product matrix, where element $c_{ij}$ is the number of times a country exports both product $i$ and product $j$.

 #+begin_src R
   ## set binary rca mat to mat
   mat <- binary_incidence_mat
   cooc_ij <- t(mat) %*% mat # co-occurrence matrix
 #+end_src

 Next I need to get a matrix containing the largest of each unit-pairs cardinality, the ~max_mat~. I get this matrix by first taking the column sums of M. This is just the number of occurrences of each product, $v$. I then build two matrices, each representing $i$ and $j$ for each pairwise comparison of largest cardinality. These matrices are just the vector $v$ put on top of each other as a row vector, or next to each other as a unit vector. I then go through the two matrices, one element at a time, selecting the largest of the two to the respective place in ~max_mat~. In other words, I check element 1, 1 in ~set_i~ and ~set_j~, and put the largest element in element 1, 1 in ~max_mat~. Next, I compare element 2, 1. And so on.

 #+begin_src R
     set_i <- colSums(mat)
     set_j <- colSums(mat)

     max_mat <- matrix(0L, nrow = length(set_i), ncol = length(set_i)) # empty matrix to populate.

     set_i <- matrix(set_i, nrow = length(set_i), ncol = length(set_i), byrow = TRUE) # col 1 is A, col 2 is B, etc
     set_j <- matrix(set_j, nrow = length(set_j), ncol = length(set_j), byrow = FALSE) # row 1 is A, row 2 is B, etc.

     for(i in 1:nrow(set_i)){
       for(j in 1:ncol(set_j)){
         max_mat[i, j] <- max(set_i[i, j], set_j[i, j])
       }
     }
 #+end_src

 Now, I just need to perform the element wise division between the co-occurrence matrix and the maximum matrix. 

 #+begin_src R
   prox_mat <- cooc_ij / max_mat
 #+end_src

 Two final notes: 
 1) NAs can be introduced due to a division-by-zero error, if there are 0s in the denominator. That is, if there are some products that are not exported with a comparative advantage at all. This only occurs if no country exports the product in the year. This should not be an issue given the cleaning procedure.
 2) The diagonal of the proximity matrix is a products similarity to itself and is therefor always 1. This is not valuable information. I set the diagonal to 0. 

 #+begin_src R
 diag(prox_mat) <- 0
 #+end_src

 The final output is a product-product matrix with values between 0 and 1. Here are the first elements:

 #+begin_src R :exports both :results output
 prox_mat[1:10, 1:5] 
 #+end_src
