For data I use the cleaned trade data in SITC rev. 2 format (four digit). I only use data for the year 2010.

   #+begin_src R 
     library(tidyverse)
     library(vroom)
     ## read data
     path <- "~/sorensfolder/sbpdata/data/sitc-rev2_tidy.csv"
     trade <- vroom(path) %>%
       filter(time == 2010) %>%
       select(-rca)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:

As written above, the definition of RCA is as follows: 

$$ RCA_{pc} = \frac{ X_{cp} }{ \sum_{p} X_{cp} } \bigg/ \frac{ \sum_{c} X_{cp} }{ \sum_{c} \sum_{p} X_{cp}} $$

First, I build a country-product matrix, where the elements are the export-value in constant dollars. This matrix is the $X$ matrix. Each element $x_{cp}$ is the intensity, i.e. the export value, of the country-product pair.

   #+begin_src R 
     mat <- spread(trade, key = unit, value = intensity) %>%
       select(-time) %>%
       column_to_rownames(var = "region") %>%
       as.matrix()
   #+end_src

I calculate RCA values in three steps. First I find the share of a products export value in a country's total exports (the numerator) for each product.

#+begin_src R
  share_unit_region <- mat / rowSums(mat)
#+end_src

The ~rowSums~ sums the product export values for each country. This results in a vector with each country's total export value. This is then divided into the intensity matrix, element-wise. It is repeated column by column, meaning that each product is divided by respective country's total export. 

Second I find the share of each products export value in the total value of global exports (denominator).

#+begin_src R
  share_unit_global <- colSums(mat) / sum(mat)
#+end_src

This is essentially the same procedure as before, but with the column sums (a vector containing the total value of a products exports over all countries) divided by a vector (global exports).

Finally, I perform the division. This is essentially that same idea as step one. I transpose the nominator-matrix in order for R to divide the vector global product shares element-wise one column at a time. Finally I transpose the result to get the country-product format for the RCA matrix.

 #+begin_src R
   incidence_mat <- t(
       t(share_unit_region) / share_unit_global
   )
 #+end_src

For most of the calculations, the RCA matrix needs to be binary. 

#+begin_src R
  binary_incidence_mat <- ifelse(incidence_mat >= 1, 1, 0)
#+end_src

The first 10 rows and 5 columns of the country-product RCA matrix, later defined as M is as follows:

#+begin_src R :exports both :results output
  incidence_mat[1:10, 1:5]
#+end_src
