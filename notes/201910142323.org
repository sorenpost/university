* R Coding association strength

The method for computing the association strength is very similar to the proximity values. The only difference is that instead of a loop populating a ~max_mat~, the matrices ~set_i~ and ~set_j~ are multiplied element-wise.

#+begin_src R 
    cooc_ij <- t(mat) %*% mat # cooccurance matrix
    set_i <- colSums(mat)
    set_j <- colSums(mat)

    set_i <- matrix(set_i, nrow = length(set_i), ncol = length(set_i), byrow = TRUE) # col 1 is A, col 2 is B, etc
    set_j <- matrix(set_j, nrow = length(set_j), ncol = length(set_j), byrow = FALSE) # row 1 is A, row 2 is B, etc.

    assoc_mat <- (cooc_ij) / (set_i * set_j) # calculate association strength
#+end_src

Again, the diagonal is set to 0. 

#+begin_src R
diag(assoc_mat) <- 0
#+end_src

The final output is a product-product matrix with values between 0 and 1. Here are the first elements:

#+begin_src R :exports both :results output
assoc_mat[1:10, 1:5] 
#+end_src
